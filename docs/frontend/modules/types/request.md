# request (`src/types/request.ts`)

## Purpose
- Legacy placeholder retained for backwards compatibility; all request types now live in `src/lib/api.ts`.

## Usage Notes
- Prefer importing the `ApiQueryRequest` and related shapes directly from `lib/api`. This file intentionally exports nothing and can be removed once external references are updated.
