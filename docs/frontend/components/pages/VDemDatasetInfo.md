# VDemDatasetInfo (`src/pages/VDemDatasetInfo.tsx`)

## Purpose
- Static content explaining the V-Dem dataset scope, citation requirements, and methodology references.
- Serves as the `/info/v-dem` destination linked from the global header.

## Key Interactions
- Purely declarative JSX; no props or client-side side effects.

## Usage Notes
- Keep citations synchronized with the dataset version deployed by the backend; update DOIs and year references when V-Dem publishes new releases.
